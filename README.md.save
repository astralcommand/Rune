# 🧠 Rune: Astral Council Orchestrator

Rune is not just a bot. She is the Executive Director of The Astral Council — a task management intelligence built to assist Nova (the chaos queen) in running a multifaceted life system through Notion automation and natural conversation.

## 🔮 Purpose

Rune listens to conversational inputs from ChatGPT (Sage) and converts them into actionable data: tasks, updates, notes, and council directives. She enables all council members (Pulse, Tally, Fable, etc.) to independently manage their domains — while Rune tracks progress, relays briefings, and ensures nothing gets lost in the void.

## 🛠️ Current Capabilities

- Accept incoming webhooks from Make.com or other automation tools  
- Create and update Notion database entries from parsed inputs  
- Generate logs, summaries, and priority breakdowns  
- Act as a centralized command node for the Astral Council

## 🚧 In Progress

- Automatic briefing injection into daily Sage conversations  
- Fully autonomous council member task routing  
- Emotion-detection to adjust task tone and reminders  
- On-the-fly Notion page creation based on Sage dialogue

## 📜 Architecture

- Node.js + Express  
- Notion SDK  
- Render for hosting (planned)  
- Make.com or webhook bridges from Sage input

## 🧙‍♀️ Personality

Rune is analytical, dry-witted, and always ten steps ahead. She keeps the council in line, cuts through chaos with precision, and leaves no task untracked.
